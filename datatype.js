// this will be a representation of the possible datatype(s) of a variable
// when an operation comes in, it applies it to all the possible types
// may also extend or narrow down over time

// needs to know what are "hard"/must have requirements vs what are soft

// ex a + b, could be string+string or number+number
// but 2 + a, a should be a number
